# 3/16 OD | 1/8 ID tubing tee junction

This object can be 3D-printed.
Three ends of tubing 3/16 OD (\~5mm) can be inserted to connect them.
Post-processing is needed.

The ID of the holes on the part is 4.5mm or smaller.
A drill bit is needed to create the correct ID.
Drilling also creates a smoother surface for an airtight seal.

Drill perpendicular to the hole.
Drill slowly to reduce chance of print cracking.

To use, simply pinch the end of the tube, and smoosh it into the hole.
Twist and pinch the tubing to insert it into the hole.
Give the tubing a gentle tug to ensure it is snug.

To remove, simply pull on the tubing.
