# Sensor bumper/mount

This object can be 3D-printed.
It serves to rigidly mount
a GY-291 ADXL345,
a CLJVL53L0XV2, and
a MaxBotix MB1240-000 to a common surface.
The flexible portion allows the mount to flex should it bump into the floor.
No post-processing is needed.

The holes accept M2.5 screws.

------
Supports should not be used.
0.1mm layer height recommended.
PLA or PETG recommended.
Print slowly so that screw holes fully form.
If screw holes are too large, try increasing extrusion ratio.
