# 3/16 OD | 1/8 ID tubing clincher

This object can be 3D-printed.
It can be used to press-fit tubing 3/16 OD (\~5mm) onto a drafted 1/8 male non-barbed nipple.
No post-processing is needed.

To install this on tubing, make a cut along the tubing, about 10mm long.
Make a similar cut about 2mm around the tube.
Pull the resulting nib of tubing off.

Pull the tubing through the clincher. Needlenose pliers may help.
Cut away the excess tubing, leaving at least 3mm left outside the clincher.

To use, simply press the end of the tubing onto the nipple.
The clincher will help form a seal around the nipple.
