# 3/16 OD | 1/8 ID tubing to ballonet

This object can be 3D-printed.
Three ends of tubing 3/16 OD (\~5mm) can be inserted, forming a seal.
This can be taped between two layers of mylar balloon to form a seal.
Post-processing is needed.

The ID of the holes on the part is 4.5mm or smaller.
A drill bit is needed to create the correct ID.
Drilling also creates a smoother surface for an airtight seal.

Drill perpendicular to the hole.
Drill slowly to reduce chance of print cracking.

To install this in a balloon, place this at the entrance to the balloon.
About half of it should stick out.
Using packing tape or scotch tape, nudge a long piece of tape under the mylar.
Try not to wrinkle the balloon mylar, as this will allow air to leak.
Place a second piece of tape over the top ridge of the printed part.
The tape should have plenty of contact with both the printed part and the mylar.
Press the filleted surfaces of the part to form the seal.
Press the tape together to form the seal.
An example of what the finished product should look like is given in the report.

To use, simply pinch the end of the tube, and smoosh it into the hole.
Twist and pinch the tubing to insert it into the hole.
Give the tubing a gentle tug to ensure it is snug.

To remove, simply pull on the tubing.
