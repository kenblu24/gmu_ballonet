# gmu_ballonet

This is the repository for a Senior Design project. We are working on a ballonet for an autonomous blimp, along with control software to keep the blimp at a set level.

This project runs on an ESP32 running micropython. The repo also contains design files for 3D printed parts used to build the final product.
